This is a project for my Engineering project at Mcmaster University.

BFrendr is a web app intended to help people make friends and connections with like-minded individuals when they might not otherwise be able to. Users are able to create profiles including name, bio, profile picture, and various interests. Users can then search for potential friends, either by looking at profiles from a suggested match or through a search feature. They can then send messages to potential friends, and if they have a match, can choose to meet up with them.
